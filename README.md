# Hangman Interview Exercise

## Instructions

The point of this exercise is to see if you can
write a program which, using `input.txt`,
will produce output identical to `expected_output.txt`.

You can test your work by modifying the executable file called `hangman` and
then running `./completeness_test`.

To be clear, this program is not meant to take actual user input. This program is only meant to read `input.txt` as simulated user input.

The time allowed for this exercise is 30 minutes. Please note that this is NOT a pass/fail exercise in terms of getting the program all the way finished. I don't expect you to finish the program in 30 minutes. The point of this exercise is just to see how you approach the problem.
